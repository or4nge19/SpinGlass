# Guerra's bound: algebraic core (finite `N`)

The analytic part of Guerra's interpolation (differentiation under the disorder expectation,
Gaussian IBP, and endpoint evaluation) is substantial.  This file isolates the *finite‑`N`
algebraic* inequality that is the key ingredient once the derivative identity is established.

See `SpinGlass/Defs.lean` for the underlying trace computations and for the proof that the
relevant combination is bounded by \((β^2/4)(1-q)^2\) via nonnegativity of a Gibbs average of a
square.

**Finite‑`N` Guerra derivative bound (algebraic part).**

This is the inequality corresponding to Talagrand's Eq. (1.65) *after* Gaussian IBP has reduced
the derivative of the interpolated expected free energy to a trace of the covariance kernels
against the Hessian. Generalized for RSB with functional order parameter `xi`.
